	* [r12279] Say something sensible when aMSN is run under tcl/tk <
	  8.5 . config.tcl is broken against tcl/tk 8.4 in many parts and I
	  cannot make it work. It was only needed to load the user s
	  language preference, so we just autodetect the language based on
	  system language. Known bugs: I could not get to make it work with
	  non-latin1 chars, but in most languages it should not be a big
	  problem

	* [r12284] Wow, how come we never saw this for years? the 'zoomed'
	  state for windows does not exist on X11...
	  So if you ever maximize a chatwindow, then try to open a new CW,
	  aMSN will crash... This fixes it.

2011-01-25 22:18  vivia

	* [r12285] Fixed bug with SB thought to be inactive when sending
	  file through it :)

2011-01-28 14:21  vivia

	* [r12286] Added the snits from branch, this is first part of
	  merge. Second part will be a manual diff I m afraid. Trunk still
	  using old stack

	* [r12294] Minor bugfixes. Confirmed that cancel DOES work, added a
	  status_log debug in case it doesnt

2011-02-14 22:17  vivia

	* [r12295] Fixed SB files getting sent faster than the SB can
	  handle. We still see the wrong speed, cannot fix that

2011-02-15 13:52  baaazen

	* [r12296] a little speedup for the login process: always use the
	  cached abook and sync abook from the server in the background
	  after login like wlm does. in the case no abook cache is found
	  (i.e. new profile) the traditional way is chosen: sync abook
	  before login. seems all to work fine, but please re-check :)

2011-02-15 14:23  baaazen

	* [r12297] a small fix for newer webcams: some of them only support
	  resolutions of 640x480 and higher that made amsn crop the image.
	  now we select the lowest resolution above 320x240 in the case
	  320x240 isn't available and resize the image to 320x240 before
	  processing it.

2011-02-15 21:56  alexandernst

	* [r12298] Save as on FT was not showing the filename. Also,
	  hitting the cancel button on the save as dialog would accept the
	  file anyway.

2011-02-16 01:33  alexandernst

	* [r12299] Stop using _GetSystemTray() instead of the actual window

	  parsing the msnobj of a user. The retreive method would only
	  check for a quote at the end of the element, so the last element
	  in the xml wouldn't get modified and return with "/> appended to
	  it, breaking the base64::decode

	  profile from writing abook.xml

2011-05-24 16:30  vivia

	* [r12327] I found why SOAPs were destroyed too early!! timeout on
	  DC would destroy the object while data was transferring over
	  SB!!!!!!! now it uses up more memory in some cases but at least
	  no tk bugs :D

2011-08-25 02:31  vivia

	* [r12334] FINALLY using fileevent to determine whether we can send
	  more data on the SB or DC rather than counting unacked MSGs!!
	  This also fixes the file progress - it is now telling the truth
	  about the speed. Wow, never thought SB could reach 20KB/s!!!!

2011-08-25 02:37  vivia

	* [r12335] Removed noack argument (aka ugly hack) to WriteSB and
	  WriteSBNoNL and removed it from the calling procs

2011-08-25 10:29  vivia

2011-08-26 21:28  vivia

	  UUM instead.

2012-01-01 22:59  kakaroto

	* [r12354] Fix the chatid SB naming when using mpop.
	  We should set the right chatid depending on who joins/leaves the
	  chat, not on who sends the first MSG.
	  With mpop, you may be the one sending the first message and the
	  other amsn instance will get confused.

2012-01-01 23:07  kakaroto

	* [r12355] Added option to user properties to allow enable/disable

	* [r12364] fix black png issue

2012-05-16 19:47  vivia

	* [r12365] First p2pv2 attempt \o/ What we send seems correct, but
	  is falsely identified as v1 because peer-guid is missing, and
	  then gets discarded. No bugs, we just send one single packet and
	  then stop there. Possible bugs when parsing incoming packets.
	  TODO: get a list of all peer-guids available and send initial
	  packets to each one of them separately. Also: YATTA, I had a
	  small p2pv2 conversation with WLM, it must have been just junk
	  back and forth (too lazy to debug), but I received two
	  somethings, sent an INVITE, and received something that looked
	  like an ack!!

2012-05-17 19:37  kakaroto

	* [r12366] fix p2pv2 typo in direct FT

2012-05-17 20:44  vivia

	* [r12367] YATTA, I just ... ALMOST had a p2pv2 conversation
	  between the two accounts! INVITE, 200 OK, and some data... Too
	  tired to debug further for today :( (Please bear with my puts,
	  they are way too many, I promise to remove them when it all
	  works)

2012-05-18 11:45  lephilousophe

	* [r12368] Big cleanup of build files : needs to be tested
	  The modifications shouldn't have broken anything... but we never
	  now...
	  - Removed all variations on link_so
	  - Modified Farsight extension to use Farstream when available :
	  thanks to Tom Callaway for his Fedora patch
	  - Fixed libng problem for loading plugins due to Tcl/Tk changing
	  their dlopen from RTLD_GLOBAL to RTLD_LOCAL
	  - Split libng from webcamsn to let plugins link only on libng
	  (and libng beginning by lib is much more handy to link with)
	  - Removed many useless flags from global variables to apply them
	  only where it's needed

2012-05-18 15:31  lephilousophe

	* [r12369] - make install now installs in the libdir the arch
	  dependent librairies

	  cancel a call

2012-05-18 21:11  kakaroto

	* [r12376] I have no idea why I did this.. maybe there was a bug
	  somewhere because of this?

2012-05-20 02:23  kakaroto

	* [r12377] Slightly better p2pv2 support. Acks look correct at
	  least, but the switchboard P2P-Dest is wrong.
