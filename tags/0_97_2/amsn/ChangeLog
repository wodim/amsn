2008-06-23 17:17  billiob

	* abook.tcl: merge from trunk r10232-10233:
	  fix currentMedia not showing in top CL

2008-06-19 19:28  kakaroto

	* protocol.tcl: merge from trunk r10214 : CurrentMedia should be a

2008-06-13 05:08  kakaroto

	* loging.tcl: r10101 to branch :

	  Should fix the white screen bug for mac once more

2008-05-30 18:28  kakaroto

	* msncam.tcl: from trunk : r10062
	  Fix the white screen bug for Macs!!!!
	  the problem is that if the grabber window is not yet mapped, we
	  didn't do anything, and for a direct connection, that pretty much
	  meant that 250ms later, we get the chance to send a new frame...
	  the problem with the WSOD is that it happens when using the
	  reflector if we don't send a frame, we can't get an ACK for it,
	  if we don't get the ACK then we'll never get the writable event
	  called again, so we won't get the chance to send any frame..
	  ever.. no frame = white screen..

2008-05-28 22:52  baaazen

	  New feature.. simulate the real time framerate when viewing
	  webcam logs

2008-05-28 15:08  baaazen

	* protocol.tcl, smileys.tcl: r9414, 9415 to branch:
	  
	  9414: Refactored the smiley thing, it now returns a list of
	  smileys to send and we make that into a proper message in
	  protocol.tcl. The 5 smileys limit is also checked in protocol.tcl
	  now.
	  Removing the two 'break' statements, will make aMSN send multiple
	  x-ms-emoticon messages in order to send all smileys, but sending
	  5 at a time. This does not work with WLM though since it will
	  only show the last smileys received.. (purpose of the refactoring
	  was to test this idea).
	  
	  9415: A trick.. by moving the animated smileys into the
	  non-animated smileys message, we *could* be able to sneak in all
	  those custom smileys.. but apparently, WLM stores whether a
	  specific smiley was sent before as being an animated smiley or
	  not and will not show it again if it's animated and send as a
	  non-animated smiley.... so the code is there, but it's commented
	  out...
	  Also removed a debug output...

2008-05-28 14:56  baaazen

	* protocol.tcl: r9387 to branch:
	  
	  XML encode everything.. you never know where an '&' could get in
	  the middle of our xml...

	* utils/base64/base64.tcl: r9360 to branch:
	  
	  fix bug #133

2008-05-28 14:41  baaazen

	* proxy.tcl: r9348 to branch:
	  
	  Polling should be done every 2 seconds just like the official
	  client does.. 5 seconds are too much, + it will make us waste 5
	  seconds of reading the webcam/file transfer ip/ports so once we
	  read them, we'll already have timed out and start using the
	  SB/reflector...

2008-05-28 14:36  baaazen

	  utils/windows/reg1.1/pkgIndex.tcl,
	  utils/windows/reg1.1/tclreg11.dll: r9934 to branch:
	  
	  Use the 'registry' extension on windows for getting, adding,
	  setting, deleting the 'run amsn on boot' registry key.
	  Now the 'start amsn on windows boot' option is not in an unknown
	  state, we go fetch the value to make sure the option is checked
	  correctly, depending on the actual value in the registry. We also
	  now check for the appropriate file, if ../amsn.exe doesn't exist
	  (for example, you have tcl installed, amsn svn, but no amsn
	  installed from the official installer), then it will use the path
	  of the wish.exe executable with the name of the amsn script
	  launched so it will still launch correctly.
	  This will also probably fix those nasty annoyances
	  pseudo-security popups in vista, or fix it if it wasn't able to
	  work at all on vista.

	  everything goes there... fixes aMSN freezing when using HTTP
	  connection and receiving a UBN command (like when receiving an
	  audio call invite)...
	  
	  9809: hopefully no more HTTPPoll bug...

2008-05-28 12:16  baaazen

	  firewall checker can be moved to it's own ip-address now, if we
	  go that road we can make sure it does not interfere with the

	  Fixes armas's problem with proxy connections. We were not
	  following the RFC 2616 which states that an HTTP header field
	  should be case insensitive, so we were checking the
	  "Content-Length" while his proxy gave "Content-length" (lower
	  case L).
	  Now using a regexp and skipping the LWS as stated in the RFC2616
	  and trimming the result correctly...

	* protocol.tcl: Apply fix from -r9362:
	  add protocol debug output for MSNP2P data received on direct
	  connections. Show only packets with an offset of 0 to avoid
	  flooding the protocol window when receiving a file (only first
	  chunk will be shown though..)
	  Also made the fileevent that writes on the DC socket wait 5 ms
	  before getting called. When doing direct transfer on a local
	  network, aMSN would COMPLETELY freeze, using 100% of CPU,
	  impossible to do anything, it doesn't even refresh the window.. I
	  calculated that 5ms should be enough without dropping much of
	  performance. I added the 5ms timer and aMSN became fully
	  functional, as if no transfer was being done. The transfer speed
	  went from 540KB/s to 520KB/s so it's good! :)

2008-01-23 20:43  thaven

	* msnp2p.tcl, protocol.tcl: Apply fix from -r9361:
	  Hourray, this should fix our problems with the file transfers
	  getting canceled... the problem was that during a file transfer,
	  we could receive some MSNP2P data to which we send an Ack
	  message.. the ACK increments the blobID in SessionList which
	  causes all subsequent data sent to have a wrong blobID so WLM
	  ignores them then times out and cancels the FT.
	  Also, this fixes the most probable cause of the failing FTs.
	  Whenever WLM misses a packet, it will send a NACK msnp2p message
	  telling us to start sending the file from position X. If we don't
	  give him the appropriate offset, it will not like it and keep
	  NACK-ing everyone of our packets. After 2 minutes, if we didn't
	  reinitialize our file position to the one WLM asks for, it will
	  cancel the FT. This is now taken into account and if we receive a
	  NAK for a file transfer's packet, we will seek to the appropriate
	  position and reinitialize our offset to send the right data. I
	  tested this in direct connect, but it needs testing when done
	  over the SB although should work just fine.
	  In order to test this, send a file to a WLM user, then watch your
	  status log while you type :
	  set ::msn6ft_test_nak_once 1
	  it will switch between two buffers (send buffer at position X+1
	  before sending buffer at position X). Which will make WLM nak it,
	  and in theory, we should be able to avoid damage and continue
	  from where we were (two naks, one for the buffer at X which is
	  sent right after X+1, so the nak is answered, and then we send
	  X+2, so it skipped X+1, so we get a second nak to which we must
	  answer).

	* configure, configure.ac: Apply fix from -r9234:

	  those options to become enabled....
	  Patch was provided by the gentoo dev team :
	  http://sources.gentoo.org/viewcvs.py/gentoo-x86/net-im/amsn/files/amsn-0.97_rc1-autoconf-logic.patch?rev=1.1&view=log
	  --------
	  closes bug #179467. Suggested ebuild not used as I had to tame a
	  wild build system that was pre-stripping binaries and not
	  listening to --enable flags. Thanks to Edge <edge87@gmail.com>
	  for help with a test account. Dropped ~alpha & ~hppa keywords
	  over dev-tcltk/snack dependency, filed bug #185250.
