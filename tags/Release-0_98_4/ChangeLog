	  ignoring certificate errors for now...

	  discovery and initial patch for tktray was from tjikkun. Thanks!

	* Call newcontact only for users on PL, not those in
	  RL-but-neither-AL-nor-BL

2010-06-10 [r12047]  kakaroto:

	* Fix sending OIMs when using MSNP18 and MPOP. The problem was that
	  we would receive our x-clientcaps from the other side, which
	  triggers the handleMSG which assumes "if we receive a MSG then we
	  have at least one user in the conversation!" so it checked how
	  many we are and if it's != 1 (in this case it's still zero), then
	  it thinks we're in a multi chat and tries to change the chatid..
	  We also need to fix every occurence of ::OIM_GUI::IsOIM and give
	  it the proper email instead of the chatid since the chatid could
	  be ::MSN::SBXXX...

2010-06-10 [r12048]  billiob:

	* Update thai translation

2010-06-10 [r12049]  vivia:

	* Fixed Portuguese language file

2010-06-17 [r12053]  kakaroto:

	* Force tcl/tk 8.5 as minimal version for aMSN. This is needed for
	  both tcl-oo (coming soon) objects and for the -cadir option to
	  work with tls. On 8.4, currently aMSN does not connect at all

2010-06-17 [r12054]  billiob:

	* update spanish translation, thanks to Jesús Vidal Panalés

2010-06-17 [r12055]  kakaroto:

	* update italian and french translation. Fix english and spanish
	  ones. Thanks to Montblanc

2010-06-30 [r12057]  billiob:

	* update dutch translation, thanks to Ton .

2010-07-08 [r12070]  kakaroto:

	* Stupid windows! The documentation clearly says that if we do the
	  flash STOP flag it will stop flashing... but apparently it only
	  'stops' flashing for 5 to 10 seconds, then it reflashes it... so
	  this causes the flash to appear twice per window, which is
	  annoying...

2010-07-14 [r12079]  vivia:

	* Fixed bug when using socks proxy and getting kicked at a bad
	  timing

2010-07-14 [r12080]  vivia:

	* Enable inkdraw by default, no reason to keep it disabled anymore

2010-07-30 [r12103]  vivia:

	* If ABFindAll or FindMembership fails, just use cached CL data and
	  show a message. Just need to re-test this with MSN servers
	  working, although it really should still work :)

2010-07-30 [r12104]  vivia:

	* baka... we should delete all contacts BEFORE reloading the real
	  CL with ABFindAll, not AFTER we do, otherwise the contact list is
	  empty. also, hopefully SynchronizeDone does not get called too
	  early, when just one of the two SOAPs fails, causing an empty CL
	  again, but I cannot test since problems seem fixed.

2010-07-30 [r12105]  vivia:

	* This should work better, though the code is kinda insane!!!

2010-07-31 [r12110]  alexandernst:

	* Don't save home/work/mobile/pager numbers. Sending PRP
	  PHH/PHW/PHM/MOB will result in 715 always.

2010-11-22 [r12243]  billiob:

	* wtf is this?

2010-11-30 [r12244]  kakaroto:

	* Should finally fix that elusive bug #2265. Flush the socket data
	  when the socket is reconfigured! The problem was that if you got
	  disconnected while receiving a command that requires a payload,
	  then on the next connect, it will just append the VER x MSNP15 to
	  that, then it will think that it requires a payload, but since
	  MSNP15 is not an int, it will just refuse to read anything.. and
	  reconnect... forever, and eventually the dataBuffer just keeps
	  growing forever, never processing the data in it.
