	  Enabled option to disable keepalive per request. Disabled
	  keepalive for ABFindAll and FindMembership, otherwise they ll
	  need a very long time to reply and might time out. Disabled
	  keepalive for GetProfile on all offline users because we d rather
	  send all requests at once and finish quickly than send them

2009-12-17 06:28  kakaroto

	* utils/http/http.tcl: haha, found the problem with the http
	  changes.. the ::http::wait command doesn't wait until
	  $token(status) *changes*, it waits until it *gets defined*.. so
	  when I got connected, and I set it to 'connect' (just as an FYI),
	  it stopped my wait, and the second wait I added would return
	  directly instead of waiting for the actual 'ok/error'... this is
	  also why we had those Event errors.. you would get the
	  http::geturl return as soon as it connects (before
	  sending/receiving data), so we get status 'connect', oh it's
	  unknown, so we ::http::cleanup the token, but that didn't close
	  the socket, simply because it was expected that cleanup would be
	  called AFTER the error/success of the http, and that would have
	  already closed the socket for us..

	  useless for users, and useless since MSNP15+ and SOAP

2009-12-09 12:53  kakaroto

	* utils/asyncresolver/asyncresolver.tcl: disable asyncresolver
	  because it uses tkwait which causes the same issue as http
	  package (infinite loop) that I just fixed... it also didn't
	  always work so well on windows for some random people...
	  was it really useful btw? or did I just write it because I
	  thought it would be fun ?
	  Keeping the part for avoiding a reverse lookup on an fconfigure
	  -sockname though since that can be done synchronously

2009-12-09 12:41  kakaroto

	* utils/http/http.tcl: Oh God, please let this commit not crash
	  everything...
	  I just modified http package to work completely async when we use
	  the -command option, so no more vwait which causes all those
	  horrible infinite loop stack traces...

2009-12-08 22:18  kakaroto

	* protocol.tcl: get the nick/psm of the offline contacts only after
	  we set our own intial status, otherwise, because of huge network
	  bottleneck, it looks like sometimes, it could happen that the

	  reaches us... result, no nick change, no ILNs..

	  Do not send the events for nick/psm updated because of GetProfile
	  each time we get an answer, because it causes the contact list to
	  queue the redraws for the initial status change notifications
	  (ILN), so it makes the contact list show your online contacts a
	  lot later than what it can, which makes the user think amsn got
	  slower to connect...
